# code-workshop-kit README

This extension is part of [code-workshop-kit](https://code-workshop-kit.com), aimed at making the workshop experience smoother by leveraging VS Code and VS Code Live Share extension.

## Features

- Finds your `cwk.config.js` file, and updates the array of participants whenever a new user joins your Live Share session

Coming soon:

- Automatically scaffold workshop files for newly joined participants
- Once Live Share implements [file access control hook](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/4037), opt-in to preventing participants from seeing files from other participants

## Requirements

This extension works in conjunction with [code-workshop-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/code-workshop-kit), so it is advisable to only use it when you use CWK.
